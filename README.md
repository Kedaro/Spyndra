# Spyndra

Code for the Spyndra autonomous gait generation robot from the Creative Machines Lab
Robot is meant to autonomatically create and run gaits
Based off IMU data, the robot learns high quality from low quality gaits,
and eventually generates the best gait through reinforced machine learning.
